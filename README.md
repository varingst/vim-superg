# SuperG

In `vim`, `<count>G` moves you to line number `<count>`.

`<count>SuperG` moves you to the *closest line* matching `<count>$`.

When not given a `<count>`, it does not move at all.

It always operates linewise.

Vim has the spot `gG` open, but I have it mapped to `<CR>`.

Read the doc.

That is all.
