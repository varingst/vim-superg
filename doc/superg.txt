*superg.txt*  Plugin for fast, simple, linewise movement

INTRODUCTION                                              *superg*

Go to closest line matching [count]$, default current line, on the first
non-blank characther |linewise|. If 'startofline' not set, keep the same
column. |superg| is one of the |jump-motions|.

In visual mode, |superg| forces it to be |linewise-visual|.

MAPPINGS                                         *superg-mappings*

No mappings are provided by default.

|:map| {lhs} <Plug>SuperG

or |:nmap|, |:xmap|, |:omap| <Plug>SuperG individually.

OPTIONS                                           *superg-options*

You may override how |superg| behaves when it is not given a [count] by
setting g:superg_fallback to an <expr> mapping:
>
  let g:superg_fallback = "dd"
<
This will make |superg| delete the current line when not given a [count].
You might want something else.
